# My first data processing tool

Upload to AWS S3 triggers Lambda Function.

Once triggered, you can see the logs in CloudWatch.

# The codebase

We have two folders in the codebase:

- The handlers written in JavaScript.
- The terraform code to create the resources.

This was easier than I thought it'd be.

Had a lot of fun. Let's see what I'll build next. âœ¨

# The Lambda Function

As you can see in the diagram, connected to the S3 bucket.
